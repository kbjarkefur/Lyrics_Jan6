If you call me
You will know me
If you call me
I'll be there
If you call me
You will find me
If you call me
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
Running to the church yeah you gotta get back
You're gonna miss the show sitting in the front row
Call your brother up and
For far too long I sat around to die
Laying by the pool, drinking rum with the dime bags
Call your brother up and let him know
All of your friends are at the cellar door
We're gonna have to get you there before all the beer is gone
Gotta get a dance in, before the show
Call your brother up and let him know
Call your brother up and let him know
